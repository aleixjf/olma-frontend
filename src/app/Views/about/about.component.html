<h1>FAQ</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Do I have to register to use this app?</h2>
  <p>
    No! You can use the app without registering! However, if you don't register
    and you want to use Spotify services or cloud services, you'll have to login
    everytime.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you register, however, you won't need to login to your platforms anymore,
    and your library will be loaded automatically when you log in.

<section>
  <h2>Is it free?</h2>
  <p>Yes! This is still in an early state, so it's free for anyone to use.</p>

  <h2>Dropbox/OneDrive API</h2>
  <p>
    OLMA will let you connect to OneDrive or Dropbox to have read/write access
    to your Documents/Traktor 3.X.X folder, where your Traktor collection file
    is (collection.nml).
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is that, providing that you have your local music files
    synchronized to a cloud service, you could open your collection.nml from
    anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can connect to those services either as a guest (you’ll have to login
    every time to retrieve your collection file), or as an app registered user.
    If it's the latter, as soon as you login to my app, you’ll be automatically
    connected to your cloud storage service.

  <h2>Spotify API</h2>
  <p>
    The app can also connect to Spotify. Why would you connect it to Spotify?
    Because my app will automatically try to pair each track of your collection
    to its correspondent track in Spotify.
  </p>
  <p>
    If successfully paired, it will automatically fetch advanced metadata
    generated by Spotify (through Machine Learning algorithms?) such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Popularity</li>
    <li>Danceability</li>
    <li>Energy</li>
    <li>Acousticness</li>
    <li>Instrumentalness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And why do you want all this parameters?</p>
  <p>
    Well, the purpose of my app is to allow you to create even more powerful
    smartlists than Traktor’s own, allowing you to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create combined and/or Smartlists</li>
    <li>Create Smartlists with more than 8 rules.</li>
    <li>
      Create Smartlists with custom metadata fields (such as the Danceability
      field).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    It allows you to upload your local library from your local files or from a
    connected cloud storage service. It then parses your library (.nml, the file
    extension of your Traktor collection, is essentially an XML file) and it
    shows it online. It also shows your playlists and your smartlists with its
    rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once uploaded and parsed, you can then edit your smartlists (adding new
    rules to it) or create new ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what if your smartlists has more than 8 rules, or has conditions that
    don’t exist in Traktor Pro? Don't worry! When it exports your files, if the
    Smartlist doesn't meat Traktor's parameters, it will export it as a regular
    playlist.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is that, in the future, if you are registered, the next time you
    upload your Library again, my app recognized those Smartlists (which will be
    regular playlists by then) by their UUID, and recreate them as smartlists
    with the conditions you originally set!
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, once you are done, it allows you to download it again to your
    computer, or to upload it directly to your Cloud service.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      NOTE: Parsing/fetching/downloading processes may take some time, it will
      depend on the size of your Library.
    </strong>
