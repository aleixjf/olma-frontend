// Custom Theming for Angular Material
@use '@angular/material' as mat;
// Add below @use for other components.scss in your app that have mixins.
// @use "path/to/component.component" as component;

@include mat.core();
// mat.core() includes the common styles for Angular Material. We include this here so that you only
// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!

//INFO: We'll add the overrides in ITCSS
//@import "angular-material-font-overrides";
//@import 'angular-material-overrides';

// Apply the dark theme by default
// INFO: The choice of a light versus a dark theme determines the background and foreground colors used throughout the components.
@import 'dark-theme';
@include mat.all-component-themes($dark-theme);

// Apply the light theme only when the `.light-theme` CSS class is applied to an ancestor element of the components (such as `body`).
.light-theme {
  @import 'light-theme';
