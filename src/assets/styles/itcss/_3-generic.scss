3. GENERIC:

Ground Zero stylesGround Zero styles --> CSS Resets, normalizations, global box-sizing rules, etc.

The Generic layer is the first one that
actually produces any CSS. It houses very high-level,
far reaching styles. This layer is seldom modified,
and is usually the same across any projects you work on.
It contains things like Normalize.css, global box-sizing rules,
CSS resets and so on. The Generic layer affects a lot of the DOM,
hence it being nice and wide in the Triangle model, and
occurring very early on.
